>[!important] Main Gest

What holds you back form achieving your goal, eating your frog, what is your [[Bottle-Neck]]. Find it and focus of removing it.

Apply the 80/20 rule for constraints as well
[[80-20 rule#^f5b782| 80-20 works on constraints too]]

**Steps**
- Make a list of every step in a process and try finding what you cannot do, is hard, you lack confidence in doing and so on.
- Ask this question **" What is it in me that is holding me back. "**
## To Dos
1. Find your one constraint, internal and external and ask "Why haven't I solved it already? What is it in me that is holding me back ?" Then take immediate action.
