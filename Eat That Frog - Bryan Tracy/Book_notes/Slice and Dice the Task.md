# Slice and Dice the Task

>[!important] Main Jest
>Break everything into small tasks and do it one at a time just like [[Take It One Oil Barrel at a Time]]

Let's say you have a task that is relatively large and you may be lazy, then break it up into such a small task that it feels ridiculous and stupid how small it is so that when you are not motivated at all and are feeling lazy, you will still finish at least one of your task so that at the end of the day you are actually making progress, laughable low progress but progress nevertheless rather then expecting a big task aimlessly

2 methods for slicing and dicing

>[!faq] Salami Slice Method ?
> break down every task in to small slices(small task) and like eating a salami one at a time, you only focus on one task at a time

>[!faq] Swiss Cheese method ?
> You "Swiss cheese" a task by resolving to only do one task at a certain chunk of time.

>[!todo]
>1. Use the salami slice and Swiss cheese method on every task
