# Focus Your Attention
These phones are designed like slot machines where every sound and feed back you get makes you addicted and hooked on your phone. Multitasking is a myth but people lie to them selves saying they are multitasking but most of their focus is on their phones. After an Internet interruption, it takes 7 min to regain your focus on the task at hand.

Here are **6 things** you can do **to have more focus**.
1. Don't look at your email, You-Tube, TikTok etc. first thing in the morning. Mostly For the first 2 hours. Also said by [[Andrew Huberman]]
2. If you have to check them then be quick about it and block those sites/ app immediately
3. Have specific times when you go to social media.
4. [[Plan Every Day in Advance]]
5. Work 90 min nonstop and give yourself a 10 min break
6. Do that for 3 hours time and give your self a big break or maybe check social media as a reward(but would suggest[[Dont focus on Reward - Dr Andrew Huberman]])
