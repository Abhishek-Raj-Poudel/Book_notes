# Don't Start a Business If
### You have no Money
If you think that you will earn within the next 2 week/ month then that’s an employee mentality but as an entrapanure that wont happen. It may take 5 years for you to see success. So for now **Get a job** because you have to eat/pay the bill.

### If you don’t understand The industry.
Ask this question
1.  Why You ?
2.  Why Now?
3.  If you answer is "I want to make some money" then you'll fail.
4.  If you don’t know the industry then learn the industry.

### If you don’t have the stamina
1.  Meaning the mental toughness = To handle pain/ rejection
2.  What are you willing to give up.
3.  What are you willing to pay.
If your not willing to do any of these then dont start.

### If you want more free time.
-  You may have 9-5 when you are in a job but now you have from wake up till sleep , its a 18hr work day, 7 days a week
-  You don’t get to take a rest cause even in rest you keep on thinking about it
-  The first 5-10 Years (You aint getting anywhere)
-  When you get paid - You get paid last.

### If you don’t know how to close. Meaning you don't know how to sell and what sells.
