# 80-20 rule
Limit task to the important to shorten worktime. You do 80% of work in about 20 % of time, you earn 80% money from 20% clients etc that is 
the 80/20 rule. 

It even works with constraints like 80% of your constraints are internal. ^f5b782

80% of people don't care about your problems and 20% are glad you have them.  ^43bcfd

80% of email are not as important so out of lets say 20 email you have you should give your focus to only 4 of them  ^26b10f
