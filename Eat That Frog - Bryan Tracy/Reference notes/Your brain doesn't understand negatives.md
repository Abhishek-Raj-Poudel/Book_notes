# Your brain doesn't understand negatives
Here is a test of this hypothesis - **Don't Think Of A Monkey**
You probably did think of this, apparently your brain will only read the sentence without the negative part so just **Think Of A Monkey**
So lets say you want to remove smoking then don't say **I will not smoke** but probably say something like **I will workout when I want to smoke**
or things like that
