# Second Brain Principle
Our brain is for having ideas, not storing them. Building A Second Brain isÂ **a methodology for saving and systematically reminding us of the ideas, inspirations, insights, and connections we've gained through our experience**.
WE can do this with the code method.
## C.O.D.E
**C = Capture**
Write it down, in an note app or in paper
**O = Organize**
Not according to where your note should be but according to where you may use this, Eg dont store your book notes in the book folder but in the folder where you might use the knowledge of that book note.
**D = Distilling**
Try taking those notes in your own words. [[Zettelkasten]]
**E = Express**
[[Show you work]]. That is the only way you can express. Dont keep your notes/ideas. You need to convert your notes into something usefull. Dont just hord knowledge, Epress it.

## Concept of Slow Burn 
Because you have your second brain for holding your ideas, you can work on multiple project at once. Slowly buid them up togather by adding ideas that knowledge you get along the way, like your slowly cooking them all in a pot at once until their ready. Basically meaning these 10 big task wont feel like 10 big task.
