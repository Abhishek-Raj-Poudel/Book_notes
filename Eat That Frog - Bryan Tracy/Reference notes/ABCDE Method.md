- A = Must Do, Have to do, **the most importent**
- B = Should Do, **May be as important as A but not as urgent**
- C = Would be nice if it was done , **Task that you can do only after fnishing your As and Bs**
- D = Delegate
- E = Eleminate
If you have multiple important task then put it as **A1, A2, A3** and so on.
