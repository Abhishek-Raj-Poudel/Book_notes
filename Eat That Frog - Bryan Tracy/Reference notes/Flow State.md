A state where you are at your best performance. You can achieve this state if you have enough knowledge or skill in a certain task your doing so that the task is not too complex causing it to be overwhelming  and where the task is hard enough causing you to just push yourself a little bit harder(not too easy causing it to be boarding). When a Task has a perfect mixture of those two elements you will be in flow state.
